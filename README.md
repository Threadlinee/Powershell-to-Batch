# ⚡ PS to BAT - Futuristic Converter GUI

This is a next-level GUI tool built in **Python** that converts raw **PowerShell** code into fully working `.bat` scripts — all with insane visuals, **animations**, drag-and-drop support, and a sleek dark hacker-style interface.

## 🚀 Features
- 💻 Paste or drop your PowerShell code (.ps1)
- ⚙️ Instant conversion to batch format (.bat)

## 🧱 Requirements
Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed. Then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
✅ Windows tested
✅ No external APIs or weird dependencies

🛠️ How It Works
The app checks if your PS code is multiline or single-line, formats it accordingly for batch execution, and wraps it in a temporary .ps1 file (for complex payloads). It handles percent signs, quotes, and even shows you the final result with animation like a boss.
